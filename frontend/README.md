# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# IF ANYONE ELSE WORKS ON THIS AND READS THIS 

Authentication doesn't work properly and I have some error where it loads indefinitely the first time you open the website, if you "inspect" the website and go to "application" then "clear site data" it will work. No idea why or how but yeah.

The database is hosted on Supabase currently and the tables are called "Profiles" and "Requests"

I'm not sure if it works to have admins approve new users or not, I think it might?

Anyways, Melker is love. Melker is life.
Ciao!
